**What Did We do in HW1 Assignment?**

In data analysis, we may be have to work in data matrixes which have high amount of features (columns). This, due to the **Curse of Dimensionality** making it very hard for us to understand the variances/covariances in data series with a fixed number of instances (datas). That is the reason why, PCA Analysis should be done to find the best directions in space which covers the highest ratios of variances. This will be decreasing the dimensions (features) and will let us to interpret the data set in a much better way. This HW1 is a application for this aim. As we have seen on our previous courses.
