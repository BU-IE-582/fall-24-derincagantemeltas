**What did we do in HW1 Assignment?**

In data analysis, we often work with data matrices that contain a large number of features (columns). This can lead to challenges associated with the **Curse of Dimensionality**, making it difficult to interpret the variance and covariance structures within a dataset with a limited number of observations (instances). To address this, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used to identify the principal directions in the feature space that capture the greatest variance. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, PCA helps us interpret the data more effectively. Because PCA eliminates the directions so called **Noises** for us to concentrate our analysis on the **Signal** instead. This Homework 1 assignment is an application of this approach, as we have previously studied in our courses.
